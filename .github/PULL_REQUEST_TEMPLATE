Thank you for considering a contribution!

Please be aware that we currently won't merge 3rd party PRs because this repository
is temporary. We are waiting for the decision of the OpenTelemetry technical
commitee on the donation of this repository.

In case the donation gets accepted, this repository will move to the [GitHub open-telemetry organization](https://github.com/open-telemetry),
which requires signing a different CLA. At that point we will start working on reviewing and merging 3rd party PRs.
